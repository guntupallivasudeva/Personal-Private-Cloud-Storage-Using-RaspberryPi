# Personal-Private-Cloud-Storage-Using-RaspberryPi
# Creating Personal cloud storage using raspberry pi as server at home
In this project we are going to develop a personalised cloud server by using the raspberry pi and a fileserver called Next cloud in our LAN. Cloud computing is a technology which enables us to store data over internet and access it from any part of the world. As third party Cloud services are open to other users which creates an issue of security . They provide a limited amount of storage by having some control over our data , having latency even though by paying the hefty amount. The idea is about the developing personal edge cloud storage using Raspberry Pi where we create a Cloud storage for our personal use rather than relying on other Cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud etc. Personal cloud storage using Raspberry pi allows to synchronize local folder with servers in the cloud with accessing internet. It offers for free services and sharing content. All the process must be done by login into the system using OwnCloud or NextCloud.

# Advantages
Fast in upload and downloading the files.
Sharing the files between the users.
Extend the storage as much as me need.
Simple to operate, a dedicated IT professional is often not required.
Lower cost.
Easy data backup, so it’s always accessible when you need it.
